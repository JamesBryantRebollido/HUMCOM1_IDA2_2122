<p style="font-size:160%;">The Prime Material, the story is one of caution and to safeguard those you love.
     A prince fall deeply in love with a <span style="color: rgb(253, 0, 0)"><i><b>beautiful</b></i></span> nymph. He promised his hand to hers, but she of feyfolk did not return his affections.
      He was a prince and he must have a queen by his side, so he was to take her. She died by his actions and he forever mourns her. 
      He desires only her, neglecting himself and his kingdom. The tale has caused fear of the nymphs and dryads.
    For the Feyfolk, it is forever a sorrow. 
    It has caused distrust and vengeance among some feyfolk, who attack the kingdom where 
    she died searching for the <span style="color: red"><i><b>broken</b></i></span> prince. For most feyfolk, it is a tragedy and great 
    <span style="color: red"><i><b>failure</b></i></span> as the place she guarded is forever ruined.
